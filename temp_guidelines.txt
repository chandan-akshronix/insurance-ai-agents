UNDERWRITING
 
TOOLS
What
 
is
 
underwriting?
Underwriting
 
is
 
the
 
term
 
used
 
to
 
describe
 
the
 
consideration
 
given
 
to
 
an
 
application
 
for insurance, to determine whether or not a policy applied for should be issued. It is the selection
 
of
 
risks
 
and
 
an
 
effective
 
underwriting
 
means
 
a
 
profitable
 
business.
Why
 
underwriting
 
is
 
required?
The objective of underwriting is to ensure that the risk accepted by the company is corresponding
 
to
 
that
 
assumed
 
in
 
the
 
rating
 
structure.
The
 
broader
 
objectives
 
of
 
underwriting
 
policies
 
at
 
ICICI
 
Prudential
 
are
 
as
 
follows:
To
 
keep
 
actual
 
experience
 
within
 
the
 
mortality
 
assumption
 
used
 
in
 
calculating
 
the premium
 
rates
To
 
offer
 
insurance
 
cover
 
at
 
competitive
 
terms
To
 
maintain
 
equity
 
between
 policyholders
To
 
guard
 
against
 
anti-selection
To
 
offer
 
cover
 
to
 
as
 
wide
 
a
 
group
 
of
 
lives
 
as
 
possible

TIPS
Why
 
age
 
proof
 
is
 
required?
Age
 
of
 
the
 
Life
 
Assured
 
plays
 
a
 
vital
 
role
 
in
 
assessing
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
death.
The terms and conditions of a life insurance policy depend on the age of the life to be assured.
 
Hence
 
age
 
at
 
admission
 
is
 
a
 
precondition
 
to
 
the
 
acceptance
 
of
 
any
 
proposal
 
of life
 
insurance.
What
 
are
 
the
 
types
 
of
 
age
 
proofs?
Age
 
proofs
 
are
 
of
 
two
 
types:
Standard
 age
 proofs
 
-
 are
 those
 where
 date
 of
 birth
 is
 verified
 from
 the documents like birth certificate / school proof by the issuing authority before issuance
 
–
 
e.g
 
Passport
Non
 
standard
 
age
 
proofs
 
(NSAP)
 
-
 
are
 
those
 
where
 
date
 
of
 
birth
 
on
 
the
 
proof
 
is 
basis
 
self
 
declaration
 
–
 
e.g
 
Voter
 
ID
 
card
Guidelines
